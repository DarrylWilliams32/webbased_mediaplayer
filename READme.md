# Web Based Media Player
This project is a part of the Free Code Camp curriculum and this is the finished product.

## Features
The app players music from web hosted files on Amazon Web Services. It plays, pauses, skips songs, and deletes them as the user sees fit. If the user accidently deletes all songs in the list, they will be prompted to 'reset' the list to it's previous state.

## Future Updates
I'm unsure if I'll be doing any future updates on this project, as I have no desire to create more media based programs. I'll leave this in the 'To be determined' status for now.


As a developer, there are times where I use my own money to fund the resources needed for projects. Though I invest into my own projects, donations from others that would like to see projects like this or any other future projects are greatly appreciated.
